# KeyTerms - Terminology Management Tool
KeyTerms is a centralized terminology management tool.  It enables organizations to retain, share, search and standardize institutional terminology.   KeyTerms facilitates collaboration across groups within an enterprise, but also supports more localized terminological control by individual groups within the enterprise.  With its very flexible and customizable terminology model, KeyTerms provides individual groups within an enterprise the ability to curate their own terminology, with fine-grained control over which other groups can view and edit their terms.  KeyTerms allows groups within the enterprise to establish individualized annotation guidelines and term sharing policies.  It enables but does not require sharing outside of oneâ€™s group. Because all of the operations for creating, editing, searching and filtering are realized via the KeyTerms RESTful API, developers create custom user interfaces using the API and back-end search and storage capabilities to serve the needs of their own users.  The KeyTerms solution suite includes a back-end server and application programming interface (API), along with two user-facing browser-based tools: a terminology management interface for terminology management; and, an administration tool for controlling user roles and group preferences.
